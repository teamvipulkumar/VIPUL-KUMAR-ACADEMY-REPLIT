# EduPro — Online Course Platform

## Overview

A full-stack SaaS course-selling platform with dark/blue premium theme. Built on a pnpm monorepo.

## Stack

- **Monorepo tool**: pnpm workspaces
- **Node.js version**: 24
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (artifacts/course-platform) — Wouter router, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **API**: Express 5 (artifacts/api-server) — JWT auth via httpOnly cookies, Pino logging
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (lib/db) — uses `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL` (takes priority over `DATABASE_URL`)
- **API codegen**: Orval — generates React Query hooks from OpenAPI spec (lib/api-spec → lib/api-client-react)
- **Validation**: Zod (zod/v4), drizzle-zod

## Key Commands

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run API server (port 8080)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/course-platform run dev` — run frontend (port auto via $PORT)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks from OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes

## API Routes (api-server port 8080)

- `/api/auth/*` — login, register, logout, me, forgot-password, reset-password
- `/api/courses/*` — CRUD, modules, lessons, lesson completion
- `/api/enrollments/*` — my enrollments, course progress
- `/api/payments/*` — checkout, verify
- `/api/affiliates/*` — dashboard, referrals, payout requests, tracking
- `/api/admin/*` — users, analytics, revenue, affiliates, payouts, courses, settings
- `/api/coupons/*` — list, create, validate, delete
- `/api/notifications/*` — list, mark read, mark all read
- `/api/analytics/*` — summary, recent activity

## DB Schema (lib/db/src/schema/)

Tables: users, courses, modules, lessons, enrollments, payments, affiliates (referrals + payouts), coupons, notifications, platform_settings, smtp_settings, smtp_accounts, email_lists, email_list_members, contact_tags, contact_tag_assignments, email_campaigns, email_automation_rules, email_sequences, email_sequence_steps, email_sequence_enrollments, email_sends, email_templates, **automation_funnels, automation_funnel_steps, funnel_executions, funnel_execution_steps**

### Automation Report Page (FluentCRM-style)
- Route: `/admin/crm/automation/:id/report` → `artifacts/course-platform/src/pages/admin/automation-report.tsx`
- Three tabs: Chart Report (bar+line per-step), Step Report (table), Emails Analytics (reuses legacy /report aggregator)
- Individual Reporting table at the bottom: paginated per-contact runs with expand-to-step-timeline + delete
- Backend endpoints (admin only): `GET/DELETE /api/admin/crm/funnels/:id/{report,step-report,executions,executions/:executionId}`
- `triggerFunnel()` records each execution + per-step row lazily on attempt (so step-report metrics reflect real drop-off)
- Known limitation: in-flight `wait` steps are scheduled with `setTimeout`, so an API restart will leave executions stuck in `running` until manually cleaned up — replace with a persistent scheduler before high-volume use

## Features

- JWT auth via httpOnly cookies
- Simulated checkout (Stripe + Razorpay gateways — no real keys needed)
- Coupon codes with percentage/fixed discount support
- Affiliate program with referral tracking, click counting, commission calculation
- Payout request → admin approval workflow
- Progress tracking per lesson
- Admin analytics with revenue chart (recharts)
- Notification system
- Platform settings (commission rate, enabled gateways)
- CRM: email lists, tags, campaigns, sequences, SMTP with multi-account fallback
- **Visual Automation Funnel Builder** (FluentCRM-style): create funnels with trigger → action steps flow
  - Trigger types: user_signup, new_purchase, tag_applied, list_added
  - Action types: wait (X days/hours), apply_list, remove_list, apply_tag, remove_tag, send_email, end
  - Draft/Published toggle; steps added/edited/deleted inline via visual flow UI
  - Execution engine: `triggerFunnel()` in crm.ts for programmatic firing
  - **`user_signup` trigger fired from**: auth.ts /register, auth.ts Google OAuth, payments.ts simulated /checkout/guest, bundles.ts simulated /checkout/guest, **and all 6 live-gateway create-order routes** (Cashfree/Paytm/Stripe × course/bundle). Fires at user-creation time, not at payment success — so welcome email lands even if checkout is abandoned.
  - Known limitation: `wait` steps use `setTimeout` in-process — long delays do NOT survive API restart (needs DB-backed scheduler in a future PR).
